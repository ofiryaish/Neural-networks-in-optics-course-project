# Deep Image Denoising with Neural Networks in Optics

This repository includes modified code from [DeepImageDenoising](https://github.com/parasmaharjan/DeepImageDenoising), which was adapted for a course project on neural networks in optics.

## Getting Started

To run these models, you'll need the [SID dataset](https://github.com/cchen156/Learning-to-See-in-the-Dark), which contains low-light images for training and testing.
